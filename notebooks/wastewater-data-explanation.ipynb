    "- The first five have the same `coverage`. This is normal - the \"ARTIC\" protocol is a set of \"primers\" that try and gather data from specific positions (there's always the possibility for variability in this, so it's not perfect).\n",
    "    - The first five have the same frequency as well, namely 1/23. This tells us that there was a count of 1, although this number is not reported.\n",
    "- `Position` is 0-indexed.\n",
    "- There's a \"`label`\" and \"`mutation`\" column.\n",
    "    - The \"`label`\" uses a \"~\" to denote a point mutation, a \"-\" to denote a deletion, and a \"+\" to denote an insertion. The next part is the 1-indexed position. The final part is the new nucleotide, the number of nucleotides deleted, or the nucleotides added, respectively.\n",
    "    - The `mutation` column tries to convert the label to an amino acid change. It starts with \"`aa`\" if it's a mutation, `del` if it's a deletion, and `ins` if it's an insertion. Most of the bioinformatics field uses aa mutations because they have information about the structure and function of the genome. However, there's not exactly a standardized notation for this. \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the file above (the so-called \"mapped\" file), there is a \"covereage\" file. This file simply reports the coverage at every position of the genome. This is very useful when searching for mutations that we know belong to lineages: if the mutation was not observed, we know that it's count was 0 but the mapped file will have no information about the coverage. A count of 0 with a coverage of 1 doesn't mean much, but a count of 0 when the coverage is 5000 means the mutation (and therefore the lineage) is probably not present either."
